    <h1>How to make a Lasagna</h1>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>money</li>
        <li>A car to supermarket or market</li>
        <li>A device that can show the below steps</li>
        <li><strong>A human that can cook!</strong></li>

    </ul>
    <h3> Let's get started</h3>
    <p><em>Steps:</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
     </ol>
